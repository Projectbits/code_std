Below is the full Best Practices Coding Standards Document (Version 2) in markdown format, consolidating standards for PowerShell, Python, Bash, T-SQL, Ansible, and Docker. The document emphasizes color-coded output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error) for quick failure context, idempotency, validation, modularity, and explicit save/run instructions to make it easy to use with AI tools like Grok. Each section includes a complete, cut-and-paste-ready code snippet with troubleshooting tips. Following the document, I'll provide detailed suggestions for incorporating it into your workflow, including how to make it reusable across Grok sessions.
If you prefer a Word or PDF version, let me know, and I can guide you on converting this markdown or provide a formatted version. Since I can't directly associate files with your account, the workflow suggestions will focus on practical ways to keep this document accessible and integrated into your coding sessions.

    General Principles (#general-principles)
    PowerShell Coding Standards (#powershell-coding-standards)
    Python Coding Standards (#python-coding-standards)
    Bash Coding Standards (#bash-coding-standards)
    T-SQL Coding Standards (#t-sql-coding-standards)
    Ansible Coding Standards (#ansible-coding-standards)
    Docker Coding Standards (#docker-coding-standards)
    Implementation and Reusability (#implementation-and-reusability)

General Principles

    Readability: Write clear, self-explanatory code with consistent formatting (4-space indentation) and meaningful names.
    Idempotency: Ensure scripts produce the same result on repeated runs (e.g., check existing states before changes).
    Validation: Validate inputs, prerequisites, and outcomes to prevent errors.
    Feedback: Provide color-coded terminal output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error) with timestamps for quick failure diagnosis.
    Modularity: Break code into reusable functions, roles, or procedures.
    Error Handling: Use try-catch or equivalent with detailed error messages and logging.
    Logging: Log execution details to a file for troubleshooting.
    Version Control: Use Git with descriptive commit messages (e.g., feat(script): add logging, fix(error): handle null input).
    Testing: Include assertions or unit tests to validate behavior.
    Instructions: Provide clear save/run instructions with each snippet, including troubleshooting steps.

PowerShell Coding Standards
Purpose: Automate Windows tasks with scripts that provide clear feedback and modularity.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use PascalCase for scripts (e.g., Get-SystemInfo.ps1) and Verb-Noun for functions (e.g., Get-SystemInfo). Use approved verbs (Get-Verb).
    Header: Include a detailed comment block with metadata (synopsis, description, version history).
    Parameters: Define at script start with [CmdletBinding()] and clear defaults.
    Feedback: Use Write-Host with color-coded output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error) and timestamps.
    Idempotency: Check existing states (e.g., Test-Path, Get-Service) before changes.
    Error Handling: Use try-catch-finally with detailed error messages.
    Logging: Implement a Write-Log function to save execution details to a file.
    Modularity: Use regions (#region) and functions for organization.
    Testing: Include validation checks or use Pester for unit tests.

Instructions:

    Save: Save as Get-SystemInfo.ps1 in a directory like C:\Scripts.
    Run: Open PowerShell, navigate to the directory (cd C:\Scripts), and execute: .\Get-SystemInfo.ps1 -ComputerName localhost.
    Prerequisites: Ensure PowerShell 5.1 or later is installed. No additional modules required for this example.
    Troubleshooting: Check C:\Logs\SystemInfo.log for detailed logs. Red output indicates errors (e.g., "Cannot connect to localhost. Check network or hostname"). Verify network connectivity or hostname if connection fails.

Python Coding Standards
Purpose: Write portable, maintainable Python scripts with clear feedback for automation and data processing.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use snake_case for files, variables, and functions (e.g., process_data.py, parse_config). Use CamelCase for classes (e.g., DataProcessor).
    Header: Include a module docstring with metadata (purpose, version, changelog).
    Parameters: Use descriptive function arguments with type hints where possible.
    Feedback: Use print with colorama for color-coded output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error).
    Idempotency: Check existing files or states (e.g., os.path.exists).
    Error Handling: Use try-except with specific exception handling.
    Logging: Use the logging module to save execution details.
    Modularity: Define small, focused functions with clear docstrings.
    Testing: Use unittest or pytest for unit tests.

    Troubleshooting: Check logs/process_data.log for detailed logs. Red output indicates errors (e.g., "File input.txt not found"). Ensure input.txt exists in the script directory or verify file permissions.

Bash Coding Standards
Purpose: Automate Linux/Unix tasks with robust, portable scripts.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use snake_case for scripts and functions (e.g., backup_data.sh, check_disk_space). Use UPPER_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRIES).
    Header: Include a comment block with metadata (purpose, version, changelog).
    Parameters: Use positional parameters or getopts with clear defaults.
    Feedback: Use echo with ANSI color codes for output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error).
    Idempotency: Check existing files or states (e.g., [ -f file ]).
    Error Handling: Check command exit codes and use trap for error handling.
    Logging: Redirect output to a log file with timestamps.
    Modularity: Use functions with local variables.
    Testing: Use assertions or bats for testing.

    Prerequisites: Bash 4.0+ (standard on most Linux distributions).
    Troubleshooting: Check logs/backup_data.log for logs. Red output indicates errors (e.g., "File data.txt not found"). Ensure data.txt exists or check disk permissions.

T-SQL Coding Standards
Purpose: Manage SQL Server databases with reliable, maintainable scripts.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use PascalCase for scripts and objects (e.g., Create-UserTable.sql, spUpdateCustomer). Prefix stored procedures with sp or usp, functions with fn or tvf.
    Header: Include a comment block with metadata (description, version history).
    Parameters: Declare at the start of stored procedures with clear data types.
    Feedback: Use PRINT or RAISERROR with color-coded output in SSMS (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error).
    Idempotency: Use IF NOT EXISTS and MERGE for safe execution.
    Error Handling: Use TRY-CATCH with transaction management and error logging.
    Logging: Log errors to an ErrorLog table.
    Modularity: Use stored procedures and functions for reusable logic.
    Testing: Use tSQLt or custom assertions for testing.

    Run: Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to your SQL Server instance, open the file, and execute (F5).
    Prerequisites: SQL Server 2016 or later.
    Troubleshooting: Check the ErrorLog table (SELECT * FROM ErrorLog) or SSMS Messages tab. Red output (via RAISERROR) indicates errors (e.g., "Failed to create UserTable"). Verify database permissions or schema.

Ansible Coding Standards
Purpose: Automate infrastructure tasks with idempotent, modular playbooks.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use kebab-case for playbooks and roles (e.g., deploy-web-server.yml, web-server). Use snake_case for variables (e.g., web_server_port).
    Header: Include a YAML comment block with metadata.
    Parameters: Define variables in vars or defaults with clear defaults.
    Feedback: Use debug module for color-coded output (simulated via message formatting).
    Idempotency: Use Ansible’s built-in idempotent modules (e.g., package, file).
    Error Handling: Use failed_when and changed_when for custom error conditions.
    Logging: Log task results to a file on the target host.
    Modularity: Organize code into roles and tasks.
    Testing: Use ansible-lint or test playbooks in a staging environment.

    Troubleshooting: Check /var/log/ansible_deploy.log on the target host. Debug output shows SUCCESS (green) or WARNING (yellow). Red errors indicate failures (e.g., package installation issues). Verify package manager or network connectivity.

Docker Coding Standards
Purpose: Build and orchestrate containers with consistent, maintainable Dockerfiles and Compose files.
Key Guidelines

    Naming: Use Dockerfile or Dockerfile.<env> (e.g., Dockerfile.dev). Use docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.<env>.yml (e.g., docker-compose.dev.yml).
    Header: Include a notes block with metadata.
    Parameters: Use ENV for environment variables with clear defaults.
    Feedback: Rely on Docker build/run logs for feedback (errors in red by default).
    Idempotency: Use COPY and RUN to ensure consistent builds.
    Error Handling: Validate base images and dependencies during build.
    Logging: Configure container logging with logging driver in Compose.
    Modularity: Use multi-stage builds and separate services in Compose.
    Testing: Test images with docker run or integration tests.

Implementation and Reusability
Enhancements in Version 2

    Color-Coded Output: Added timestamps and specific failure messages (e.g., "File not found. Place it in the script directory") for immediate context.
    Instructions: Included detailed save/run instructions with prerequisites and troubleshooting steps for each snippet.
    Feedback: Enhanced logging and terminal output to highlight errors in red with actionable details (e.g., "Check permissions or disk space").
    Modularity: Ensured snippets use functions/roles for reusability and clarity.
    Validation: Added checks (e.g., file existence, connectivity) to prevent errors.

Workflow Integration Suggestions
To make this document a seamless part of your coding workflow with Grok or other AI tools, consider the following strategies:

    Document Storage and Access:
        Local Storage: Save the markdown file (coding_standards_v2.md) in a consistent location (e.g., ~/Documents/standards/). Reference it when prompting Grok.
        Git Repository: Host the document in a GitHub repository for version control and easy access. Example structure:

        /standards/
          coding_standards_v2.md
          README.md

        Commit with messages like feat(standards): update v2 with enhanced feedback. Share the repo URL with Grok for reference.
        Cloud Storage: Upload to Google Drive or OneDrive and share the link in your prompts. This ensures accessibility across devices.
        Format Conversion: Convert to Word/PDF for sharing with teams:
            Markdown to Word: Use tools like Pandoc (pandoc coding_standards_v2.md -o coding_standards_v2.docx).
            Markdown to PDF: Use Pandoc or a markdown viewer with PDF export.
            I can provide a Word/PDF version if needed—just let me know!
    Integration with Grok Sessions:
        Prompt Template: Use a standardized prompt to ensure Grok adheres to the document:

        Using the Version 2 Best Practices Coding Standards Document, generate a [language/technology] script for [describe task]. Include:
        - A header with metadata (purpose, version, changelog).
        - Color-coded output (Green=Success, Yellow=Warning, Red=Error) with timestamps.
        - Logging to a file for troubleshooting.
        - Modular functions/roles with validation checks.
        - Complete, unabridged code with save/run instructions and troubleshooting tips.
        Ensure the script is idempotent and provides clear failure context.

        Example: “Generate a Python script to read a CSV file, following the Version 2 standards.”
        Session Reference: At the start of each session, paste a summary of the standards or the relevant section (e.g., Python guidelines). Alternatively, reference the document’s URL or key principles:

        Follow my Version 2 Coding Standards: use snake_case for Python, include color-coded output with colorama, and provide logging. Generate a script for...

        Persistent Context: Since Grok can’t store files in your account, maintain a “cheat sheet” with key standards (e.g., naming conventions, feedback format) in a note-taking app or text file. Share this with Grok as needed.

        The snippets are designed to be complete and modular, making them ideal for copying from Grok’s responses or the document.
        When requesting code, specify: “Follow my Version 2 standards, ensuring color-coded feedback, logging, and instructions.”
        Test snippets in a sandbox environment (e.g., a VM or Docker container) to verify behavior before production use.
    Troubleshooting Workflow:
        Immediate Feedback: Red output provides instant failure context (e.g., “Cannot connect to localhost. Check network or hostname”). Use this to diagnose issues quickly.
        Log Analysis: Check log files (e.g., C:\Logs\SystemInfo.log, /var/log/ansible_deploy.log) for detailed execution history. Most snippets create logs in a logs/ directory or specified path.
        Grok Assistance: If an error occurs, share the red output or log excerpt with Grok:

        My script failed with this error: "File input.txt not found". Using my Version 2 standards, suggest fixes for process_data.py.

    Team Collaboration:
        Share the document with your team via GitHub or a shared drive.
        Create a README with usage instructions:

        # Coding Standards
        Use `coding_standards_v2.md` for all projects. Follow the save/run instructions in each section. For AI-generated code, use this prompt: [insert prompt template].

        Train team members to reference the document when using AI tools, ensuring consistency.
    Continuous Improvement:
        Version Updates: Periodically ask Grok to refine the document:

        Update my Version 2 Coding Standards to include JavaScript standards or add a section on CI/CD pipelines.

        Feedback Loop: If a snippet fails or needs tweaking, note the issue and request an updated version:

        The Bash snippet failed due to [issue]. Revise it to follow Version 2 standards and fix the problem.

        Extension: Add sections for new languages/technologies (e.g., JavaScript, Kubernetes) as your projects evolve.
    Automation Integration:
        CI/CD Pipelines: Incorporate the standards into your CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins). Add linters (e.g., PSScriptAnalyzer for PowerShell, ansible-lint for Ansible) to enforce naming and formatting rules.
        Code Templates: Create template files based on the snippets (e.g., template.ps1, template.py) in your project repository. Use these as starting points for new scripts.
        IDE Integration: Configure your IDE (e.g., VS Code) to use snippets or extensions that align with the standards:
            PowerShell: Use the PowerShell extension with PSScriptAnalyzer.
            Python: Use flake8 or pylint with PEP 8 settings.
            Bash: Use shellcheck for linting.
    Quick Access Tips:
        Bookmark the Document: If hosted on GitHub, bookmark the raw URL for quick access.
        Local Shortcut: Create a desktop shortcut to the markdown file or its directory.
        Grok Shortcut: Save the prompt template in a note-taking app (e.g., Notion, Obsidian) for quick copying into Grok sessions.

Next Steps

    Document Delivery:
        The markdown above is the full Version 2 document. If you want a Word or PDF version, let me know, and I can provide instructions for conversion or a formatted file.
        If you prefer a longer version with additional examples or sections, I can expand it.
    Workflow Setup:
        GitHub Repo: I can guide you through creating a GitHub repository for the document. Provide a preferred repo name, and I’ll outline the steps.
        Cloud Storage: If you use Google Drive/OneDrive, upload the markdown file and share the link with me for future reference.
        IDE Configuration: Specify your IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm), and I can suggest extensions or settings to enforce the standards.
    Refinements:
        Suggest additional languages (e.g., JavaScript, Go) or sections (e.g., testing frameworks, CI/CD).
        Request specific tweaks (e.g., more detailed logging, additional validation checks).
    Testing the Workflow:
        Try the prompt template in your next Grok session:

        Using my Version 2 Best Practices Coding Standards, generate a Python script to parse a JSON file. Include color-coded output, logging, and instructions.

        Share feedback on any issues or desired improvements.
    Team Adoption:
        If sharing with a team, I can help draft a README or training guide for using the document with AI tools.

Please let me know your preferred format (markdown is provided above), any specific workflow setup needs (e.g., GitHub repo, IDE settings), or additional refinements for Version 2. I’m all ears for your feedback to make this as seamless as possible!
